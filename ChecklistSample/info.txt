============================
Questions
============================

Where do I place my file to make it work?
  - Probably need to make a new package and dev mode project and enter the file there
How do I test my checklist in game?

How do I know the list of aircraft names to reference?
 - in the packages folder listed at the bottom of this document
How do I know the list of controls to reference?
 - they are in the asobo model xml files - some are referenced here


============================
Notes
============================

A subject is a particular control such as Parking Brake or Prop Lever or Throttle

An expectation is the expected setting or value for that subject

A clue is a reference to the control item in question

A checkpoint is an individual action or task and references a subject and expectation and a clue.

A step is a section of checkpoints such as "Before Takeoff" or "Approach"

A page is the "in-game" name for a step

A checklist is collection of one or more steps that contain the checkpoints

A checkpoint library is where common checkpoints can be stored and referenced by different aircraft checklists

Checkpoints in the library must contain an "Id" value

Checklists can then reference the shared checkpoints by setting a ReferenceId and entering the "Id" of the shared checkpoint


For the C-152, let's add - what?

To use "Fuel Selector ON" as an example:

The Aircraft file (C152.xml) has a reference to Common.xml
Common.xml has reference to: Fuel.xml
Fuel.xml has a Reference to: ASOBO_FUEL_Cutoff_Template
Template: ASOBO_FUEL_Cutoff_SubTemplate (Fuel_Subtemplates.xml)


The checklist for the C-152 has this reference:
CheclistId: Fuel_Shutoff_Valve_Open

Which references instrument:FUEL_Switch_Cutoff


=============================
Installation
=============================

Copy the Checklist files to the Checklist folder in the appropriate aircraft (see folders below)
Copy the Localization files *.loc to the Localization
